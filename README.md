# Google Minesweeper Solver
I wrote a program that solves the google browser minesweeper game because I, yep.

Put the code in VSC and open terminal and run the python file whilst the minesweeper grid is on your screen.
Printing in terminal is purely for logging but will tell if the program is unable to find an answer.

It will not guess. If it gets stuck it will just keep trying to make sure it didn't take a bad screenshot,
This will be obvious in the terminal.
